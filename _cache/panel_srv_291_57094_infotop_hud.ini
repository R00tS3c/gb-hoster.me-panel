# You can use this file to create your own customised info HUD message
# Line with a hash sign ( # ) as a first character is a comment, and will not appear in the message
# Keep in mind that empty lines are NOT ignored!
#
# There are few "format specifiers" which you can use in your message, they will be replaced when shown to a player.
# Format Specifiers:
# 	%H, %M, %S - Current time (Hours, Minutes, Seconds)
# 	%m - Current map name
# 	%n - Next map name
# 	%p - Current number of players online
# 	%c - Server capacity (maximum players)
# 	%l - Time/Rounds left, depending on mp_maxrounds/mp_timelimit cvars.
# 	%i - Server IP
# 	%h - Host name
# 	%% - A SINGLE percentage sign
#
# For example:
# 	Welcome to %h!
# 	Add our IP to favorites: %i!
# Would display something like:
# 	Welcome to KliPPy's Public Server!
# 	Add our IP to favorites: 192.168.0.100!
