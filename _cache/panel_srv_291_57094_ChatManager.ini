[Format Definitions]
# In this section you can define chat formats that you can assign to different users in the [User Formats] section.
# You should create a different format for the say and say_team chat, if you don't wan't them to look the same.
# You can use the following placeholders: $admin_prefix$, $dead_prefix$, $team$, $name$, $custom_name$, $ip$, $steam$, $userid$, $chat_color$, $message$, $time$
# You can also use these, but they need to be enabled in the .sma file first: $health$, $armor$, $frags$, $deaths$, $city$, $country$, $country_code$, $continent$, $continent_code$
# Using OciXCrom's Rank System gives you access to even more placeholders: $rank$, $current_xp$, $next_xp$, $level$, $next_level$, $next_rank$. Only the first one is enabled by default.
# To enable an additional placeholder, simply locate the #define ARG_ line in the beginning of the .sma file and uncomment it (remove //), then recompile the plugin.
# Syntax: format name = format style

# In the sections down below you can set different prefixes, chat colors and custom names for each player or a group of players.
# You can add an unlimited amount of these extras. Each new extra needs to be added on a new line in the correct section.
# Bear in mind that the extras that are higher in the list have priority over the ones below them.
# This means that if a player for example meets the requirements for 2 or more prefixes, he will receive the one that's first in the list.

# In the syntaxes, you will find a parameter called "type". This parameter can be one of the following: flag, name, ip, steam, anyflag or noprefix.
# If it's set to "flag" (or "flags"), the plugin will check if the player has ALL of the admin flags set in the "info" parameter. You can set multiple flags instead of only one.
# The "name", "ip" and "steam" settings will check if the player's name, IP or SteamID is equal to the one set in the "info" parameter.
# When set to "anyflag", it will check if the player has ANY of the admin flags specified in the "info" parameter.
# Setting it to "noprefix" will check if the player doesn't have a prefix set. The "info" parameter doesn't have a function in this case, so you can leave it blank.

# If you're using OciXCrom's Rank System, you can also use the parameter "level" to check the user's level.

# The "expiration date" parameter is optional, so you can skip it. If set, this will be the date until the extra will be active.
# If the date has passed, the plugin will ignore the entire line. Dates must be written in the same format as set in the DATE_FORMAT setting.
# If the DATE_FORMAT setting is empty or not found in the [Settings] section, the plugin will ignore the expiration date and the extra will be active all the time.
